================OVERLOADING==========
definition: A class has multiple methods having same name but different in parameters 
means differ by number of input parameters or input type, is known as Method Overloading.

Method overloading in Java is also known as Compile-time Polymorphism, Static Polymorphism, 
or Early binding.In Method overloading compared to the parent argument,
the child argument will get the highest priority.

-----------------------------
Different Ways of Method Overloading in Java
1.Changing the Number of Parameters.
2.Changing Data Types of the Arguments.
3.Changing the Order of the Parameters of Methods

------------------------------
Advantages of Method Overloading 
=> Method overloading improves the Readability and reusability of the program.
=> Method overloading reduces the complexity of the program.
=> Using method overloading, programmers can perform a task efficiently and effectively.
=> Using method overloading, it is possible to access methods performing related functions with slightly different arguments and types.
=> Objects of a class can also be initialized in different ways using the constructors.



======================  OVERRIDING IN JAVA ==================
Definition: Overriding is a feature that allows a subclass or child class to provide a specific implementation of a method 
that is already provided by one of its super-classes or parent classes. 
When a method in a subclass has the same name, the same parameters or signature, and the same return type(or sub-type) as a method in its super-class, 
then the method in the subclass is said to override the method in the super-class.

Method overriding is one of the ways by which Java achieves Run Time Polymorphism.
The version of a method that is executed will be determined by the object that is used to invoke it.
If an object of a parent class is used to invoke the method, then the version in the parent class will be executed, 
but if an object of the subclass is used to invoke the method, then the version in the child class will be executed.
